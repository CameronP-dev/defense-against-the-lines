## Defense Against The Lines

This is a JavaScript project made for my Introduction to Internet Applications course.
 
It is meant to show off the many built-in methods of the HTML5 canvas and make something that I actually found quite fun to play.

The game starts shortly after the page opens, so be ready!

#### CONTROLS

- `SPACE	`- Pause

- `D		`- Fire Silo Omega
